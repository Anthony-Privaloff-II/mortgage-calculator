Mortgage Calculator Application

This is a simple WindowsForms application that takes a Mortgage Amount, Interest Rate, and Period (In years) and calculates the Total Cost and Monthly Payment of a Mortgage. 

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate my experience with C# and .NET, and using them to create a WindowsForms application that follows the 'Model View Presenter' pattern.
The application also demonstrates experience with Unit Testing. The test methods I use to test this application can be found in: /tests/MortgageCalculatorTests/InputTests.cs

This application uses the Mortgages.mdf local SQL Database as a Data Source to demonstrate experience with SQL and integrating SQL in .NET / C# applications.
The ability to save, load and delete Mortgage profiles stored as rows in the Mortgages table of the database is what I am currently working on, and will be completed within the next one or two updates.

I created this application to brushup on the fundamentals of architectural patterns in UI applications, and in doing so create a program that will compliment a portfolio.
